# Advent of code, readme if stuck

#### 1. Only consider what you **need**
It's usually the answer rather than any intermediate data, you probably don't need half of the other stuff.
#### 2. Read and re-read the question
There is a reason you've been given stuff, look for patterns in the data / question text.
#### 3. Write out your solution (and understanding of it) on paper
This helps force you to do rubber duck programming.
#### 4. Use the test data 
Write out what you want the output to be for each step and then write code to create it.
#### 5. Don't look up the solution and don't cheat
You'll hate yourself for it. It won't be your own victory and you'll feel even more stupid later.
#### 6. Think about a solution in a different way
Try reversing the algorithm, try only calculating the totals
